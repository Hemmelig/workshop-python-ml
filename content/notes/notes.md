# Applied Intro to Machine Learning Workshop

This repository will present an applied introduction to machine learning.

* What is "ML"
* Regression vs Classification

Applied example which shows, via a Jupyter notebook:
* Using Decision Trees to classify signals from a high energy physics experiment
* Cross Validation
* Hyperparameter search
* Data visualization
* Model performance visualization

Make sure you download and decompress the [SUSY dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SUSY):

This can also by done by running the python script `examples/download_susy.py` in your terminal of choice:

```bash
