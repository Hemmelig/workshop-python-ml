# Applied Intro to Machine Learning Workshop

This repository will present an applied introduction to machine learning.

* What is "ML"
* Regression vs Classification

Applied example which shows, via a Jupyter notebook:
* Using KNN Classifier to classify images of handwritten digits
* Cross Validation
* Hyperparameter search
* Model performance visualization

# Getting started

## Grabbing the Machine learning code

The majority of this workshop will be taught through the use of a Jupyter notebook, [which you can download from here](https://github.com/hackersatcambridge/workshop-python-ml/archive/master.zip). Everything you need is in the `examples` folder.

Alternatively, you can clone [the repository](https://github.com/hackersatcambridge/workshop-python-ml) using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hackersatcambridge/workshop-python-ml
```
