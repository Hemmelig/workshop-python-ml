This workshop will cover some of the tools and workflow for getting started with applied ML. Attendees will learn how to use jupyter notebooks, and the scientific python ecosystem to experiment with machine learning. 

Learning outcomes

* Create and run jupyter notebooks, virtual lab notebooks for interactive, reproducible python programming
* Learn how to use the SkLearn implementations of common machine learning algorithms 
* How to visualise results with matplotlib
* A high level understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts: supervised vs unsupervised learning, classification vs regression, cross validation, loss minimization, hyper parameter search
* Pointers to resources for further learning
